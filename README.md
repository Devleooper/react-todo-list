# React todo list :fire:

This is a simple react js project created with **Create-react-app**. implementing unit testing with jest and enzyme and showing react js basic concepts.

# Installation & deployment

Clone the current repo and just execute :

> npm install &&
> npm start

# run tests

you can run the tests executing the **Create-react-app** default way

> npm run tests

if you want to execute by command line just need to install jest cli and execute inside the root project folder

> jest
> jest --coverage (coverage report)

I am actually learning , any feedback will be well receipt!
